# FrcMatchScouting2k20
Frc 4388 match scouting code for the 2020 season

This was built from the ground up for the 2020 Frc Seson for FIRST team 4388. This is run on AWS and shiny server.
There is also a r-studio server that was used for code editing on the AWS server. 

This code was built to allow the scouts and the drive team match to match live updating data, and allow scouts to see the final visualizations.
